# APP
The code of APP, which is proposed in
**Scalable Graph Embedding for Asymmetric Proximity.**
*Zhou, Chang and Liu, Yuqiong and Liu, Xiaofei and Liu, Zhongyi and Gao*, Jun AAAI 2017.

The code is received from Chang Zhou (zhouchang915@gmail.com):
> Back in 2016, we deploy the algorithm using a java-based distributed graph engine similar to Apache Giraph, so it's in Java. The source vectors will be in _vec file, and the target vectors will be in _vec_con. The input has the adjacency list format, and we attached a example data used in our paper.
